    <h3>Biological application</h3>

    <p>These images are of human HT29 colon cancer cells, a cell line
      that has been widely used for the study of many normal and
      neoplastic processes.  For
      instance, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2006.01.040">Moffat
      et al. (<i>Cell</i>, 2006)</a> screened a set of about 43,000
      such images for mitotic regulators.  Their analysis followed the
      common pattern of identifying and counting cells with a
      phenotype of interest (in this case, cells that were in
      mitosis), then normalizing the count by dividing by the total
      number of cells.  Such experiments depend on accurate cell
      counts.</p>


    <h3>Images</h3>

<p>The image set consists of 6 fields of view
from <a href="../BBBC017/">Moffat et al.'s RNAi screen</a>.  The cells
in all six images have been treated with an RNA interference reagent
(Rock1_1885_k27).  The samples were stained with Hoechst 33342, pH3,
and phalloidin.  Hoechst 33342 is a DNA stain that labels the nucleus.
Only the images of the Hoechst 33342 channel are included, as the
other channels are not useful for counting cells.</p>

<p>The images were acquired at the Whitehead-MIT Bioimaging Center on
  a Cellomics ArrayScan. The image size is 512 Ã— 512 pixels. The
  images are provided in the native DIB format and converted to 8-bit
  TIFF files.</p>

    <h3>Ground truth {{C}}</h3>
    
    <p>A tab-delimited text file contains cell counts in each of the 6
    images, as determined by two different human counters.  To compare
    an algorithm's results to these, first compute for each image the
    absolute difference between the algorithm's count and the average
    of the humans' counts, then divide by the latter to obtain the
    deviation from ground truth (in percent).  The mean of these
    values over all 6 images is the final result.</p>

    <p>The two human observers vary by 11% for this image set. </p>
