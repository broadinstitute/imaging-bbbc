    <h3>Description of the biological application</h3>
    <p>This image data set was created for the Kaggle 2018 Data Science Bowl sponsored by Booz Allen Hamilton with cash prizes. This image set was a testing ground for the application of novel and cutting edge approaches in computer vision and machine learning to the segmentation of the nuclei belonging to cells from a breadth of biological contexts.

    These images form a diverse collection of biological images collectively containing tens of thousands of nuclei. The variety within the data set reflects the type of images collected by research biologists at universities, bio-techs, and hospitals. The nuclei in the images are derived from a range of organisms including humans, mice, and flies. In addition, nuclei have been treated and imaged in a variety of conditions including fluorescent and histology stains, several magnifications, and varying quality of illumination. Finally, nuclei appear in different contexts and states including cultured mono-layers, tissues, and embryos, and cell division, genotoxic stress, and differentiation.</p>

    <h3>Images</h3>
    <p>For each image in an image set, for example "stage1_train", there are two folders: 1) A folder named "images" that contains the image of the nuclei, and 2) a folder named "masks", which contains masks that map to every nuclei in the corresponding image.</p>
    <p><a href="stage1_train.zip"><i class="icon-download-alt"></i> stage1_train.zip (82.9 MB)</a></p>
    <p><a href="stage1_test.zip"><i class="icon-download-alt"></i> stage1_test.zip (9.5 MB)</a></p>

    <h3>Ground truth {{O}}</h3>
    <p>In addition to the images there is an accompanying collection of annotations. The annotations were originally created by the Broad Imaging Platform. The annotations take the form of a collection of masks for each image of nuclei. Each mask is a PNG file that contains the segmentation of exactly one nuclei in a folder with the same name as the image it refers to. Like the masks, the images of nuclei are also PNG.</p>
    <p>The ground truth and annotations were originally created by the Broad Imaging Platform using a combination of GIMP and a web-based annotation tool created internally. <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018/discussion/54900">[annotation strategy]</a> <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018/discussion/48347">[GIMP strategy]</a></p>
