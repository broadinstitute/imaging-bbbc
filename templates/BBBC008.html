	  <h3>Biological application</h3>

	  <p>These images are of human HT29 colon cancer cells, a cell
	  line that has been widely used for the study of many normal
	  and neoplastic processes.  A set of about 43,000 such images
	  was used
	  by <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2006.01.040">Moffat
	  et al. (Cell, 2006)</a> to screen for mitotic regulators.
	  The analysis followed the common pattern of identifying and
	  counting cells with a phenotype of interest (in this case,
	  cells that were in mitosis), then normalizing the count by
	  dividing by the total number of cells.  Such experiments
	  present two image analysis problems.  First, identifying the
	  cells that have the phenotype of interest requires that the
	  nuclei and cells be segmented.  Second, normalizing requires
	  an accurate cell count.</p>

	  <h3>Images</h3>

	  <p>The image set consists of 12 images.  The samples were
	  stained with Hoechst (channel 1), pH3 (channel 2), and
	  phalloidin (channel 3).  Hoechst labels DNA, which is
	  present in the nucleus.  Phalloidin labels actin, which is
	  present in the cytoplasm.  The last stain, pH3, indicates
	  cells in mitosis; whereas this was important for Moffat et
	  al.'s screen, it is irrelevant for segmentation and
	  counting, so this channel is left out.</p>

	  <h3>Ground truth {{FB}}</h3>

	  <p>The images were segmented into foreground and background
	  using a two-step process, where thresholding was used as an
	  initial estimate and the resulting mask was subsequently
	  cleaned up by hand.  The masks are stored as 1-bit TIFF
	  files.</p>
